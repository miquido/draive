    "# Basics of draive\n",
    "\n",
    "Draive is a framework for building high-quality applications utilizing LLMs. It provides a set of tools allowing to easily manage data flows, dependencies, and state propagation across the application. Draive is suitable for building servers, workers, and local solutions including CLI and GUI based. The core principles of the framework are strongly connected to functional programming and structured concurrency concepts. All of the draive code is fully typed as strictly as possible making as much use of the static analysis as possible. This means that numerous potential issues can be caught before running the code. It is strongly recommended to use strict, full-type linting if possible. Before you dive deeply into the code you should familiarize yourself with the basics."

    "## Defining state\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining a state that can be used within the application. The state can be an LLM configuration, details of the current user, etc. We have two base classes available in draive: `State` and `DataModel` both have a common ancestor and a similar behavior. The difference is that the `DataModel` is meant to be serializable and have an associated schema description, while the `State` does not. This distinction allows us to propagate non serializable data i.e. functions when using the `State`. Let's define a simple state:"

Additionally, both types come with built-in validation. Each object is automatically validated during the initialization ensuring proper types and values for each field. Both types are also immutable by default - you will receive linting and runtime errors when trying to mutate those. To make a mutation of an instance of either of those we can use a dedicated `updated` method which makes a copy on the fly and validates mutation as well. Let's have a look:"

First, it can't be mutated locally to have a different value only for a subset of functions. Otherwise, we introduce a globally shared, mutable state, which is a common source of bugs.
