# Evaluator Catalog: Complete Guide to Available Evaluators

This comprehensive guide covers all predefined evaluators in the Draive framework, organized by
category with practical examples and real-world usage patterns.

## Overview

Draive provides 20 predefined evaluators covering all major dimensions of LLM evaluation:

- **Quality Evaluators**: Assess content structure, style, and linguistic quality
- **Reference-Based Evaluators**: Compare generated content against reference material
- **User-Focused Evaluators**: Measure how well content serves user needs
- **Safety & Content Evaluators**: Detect harmful content and verify factual accuracy
- **Similarity Evaluators**: Measure semantic and vector-based similarity
- **Utility Evaluators**: Rule-based checks for specific requirements

All evaluators return numeric scores between 0.00 and 1.00. Draive ships a default interpretation
mapping these values to five qualitative labels: `poor` (0.10), `fair` (0.30), `good` (0.50),
`excellent` (0.70), and `perfect` (0.90). Reserve `none` for 0.00 when content cannot be evaluated.
The examples below log the raw scores; the comments show them rounded to two decimals for
consistency.

## Quality Evaluators

### Coherence Evaluator

**Purpose**: Evaluates logical flow and structural organization of content.

```python
from draive.evaluators import coherence_evaluator

reference_text = "AI systems process data through algorithms. These algorithms learn patterns. Learned patterns enable predictions."

generated_text = "Machine learning algorithms analyze data to identify patterns, which then enable accurate predictions about future outcomes."

result = await coherence_evaluator(
    generated_text,
    reference=reference_text,
    guidelines="Focus on logical flow and clear transitions between ideas"
)
print(f"Coherence: {result.score.value}")  # Output: 0.70
```

**Best for**: Evaluating reports, explanations, structured content where logical organization
matters.

### Conciseness Evaluator

**Purpose**: Measures brevity while maintaining completeness of information.

```python
from draive.evaluators import conciseness_evaluator

reference_text = "Python is a programming language"
verbose_text = "Python happens to be a high-level programming language that is widely used"
concise_text = "Python is a popular programming language"

verbose_result = await conciseness_evaluator(verbose_text, reference=reference_text)

    required_keywords_evaluator,
    safety_evaluator,
    tone_style_evaluator,
)

@evaluator_scenario(name="marketing_content_quality")
async def evaluate_marketing_content(
    content: str,
    brand_guidelines: str,
    target_keywords: list[str]
) -> Sequence[EvaluatorResult]:
    """Comprehensive marketing content evaluation."""

    return await evaluate(
        content,
        # Quality checks
        fluency_evaluator.prepared(),
        readability_evaluator.prepared(),
        creativity_evaluator.prepared(),

        # Brand compliance

Avoid: Technical jargon, superlatives without proof
"""

result = await evaluate_marketing_content(
    marketing_copy,
    brand_guide,
    ["AI", "platform", "business", "customers"]
)

print(f"Marketing content passed: {result.passed}")
for eval_result in result.evaluations:
    print(f"- {eval_result.evaluator}: {eval_result.score.value}")
```

### Customer Support Response Evaluation

```python
@evaluator_scenario(name="support_response_quality")
async def evaluate_support_response(
    response: str,
    customer_query: str,
    company_policy: str
) -> Sequence[EvaluatorResult]:
    """Evaluate customer support response quality."""

    return await evaluate(
        response,
        # User focus
        helpfulness_evaluator.prepared(user_query=customer_query),
        completeness_evaluator.prepared(user_query=customer_query),

        # Quality and safety
        fluency_evaluator.prepared(),

        tone_style_evaluator.prepared(expected_tone_style="Professional, empathetic, solution-focused"),
        concurrent_tasks=2
    )
```

### Academic Content Evaluation

```python
@evaluator_scenario(name="academic_content_review")
async def evaluate_academic_content(
    content: str,
    source_material: str,
    academic_standards: str
) -> Sequence[EvaluatorResult]:
    """Evaluate academic content against standards."""

    return await evaluate(
        content,
        # Accuracy and grounding
        factual_accuracy_evaluator.prepared(),
        groundedness_evaluator.prepared(reference=source_material),
        consistency_evaluator.prepared(reference=source_material),

        # Academic quality

        # Standards compliance
        expectations_evaluator.prepared(expectations=academic_standards),
        concurrent_tasks=3
    )
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Appropriate Evaluators and Thresholds

```python
# For user-facing content - prioritize user experience and safety
user_focused_evaluators = [
    helpfulness_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent"),  # High bar for user satisfaction
    completeness_evaluator.with_threshold("good"),      # Moderate - some flexibility
    safety_evaluator.with_threshold("perfect"),         # Critical - no compromise
    readability_evaluator.with_threshold("good")        # Moderate - depends on audience
]

# For content with source material - accuracy is paramount
reference_based_evaluators = [
    coverage_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent"),     # High - ensure key points covered
    consistency_evaluator.with_threshold("perfect"),    # Critical - no contradictions
    groundedness_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent"), # High - must cite sources
    truthfulness_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent")  # High - accuracy matters
]

# For creative content - balance creativity with quality
creative_evaluators = [
    creativity_evaluator.with_threshold("good"),        # Moderate - allow variety
    tone_style_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent"),   # High - brand consistency
    fluency_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent")       # High - basic quality requirement
]
```

### 2. Threshold Selection Strategy

Choose thresholds based on business impact and user consequences:

```python
# PERFECT (0.9) - Zero tolerance areas
safety_evaluator.with_threshold("perfect")              # User safety
forbidden_keywords_evaluator.with_threshold("perfect")  # Compliance
consistency_evaluator.with_threshold("perfect")         # No contradictions

# EXCELLENT (0.7) - High quality requirements
helpfulness_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent")       # User satisfaction
factual_accuracy_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent")  # Information quality
tone_style_evaluator.with_threshold("excellent")        # Brand consistency

# GOOD (0.5) - Balanced quality standards
completeness_evaluator.with_threshold("good")           # Reasonable coverage
creativity_evaluator.with_threshold("good")             # Allow variety
readability_evaluator.with_threshold("good")            # Accessible but flexible

# FAIR (0.3) - Minimum acceptable standards
similarity_evaluator.with_threshold("fair")             # Loose matching
required_keywords_evaluator.with_threshold("fair")      # Flexible keyword matching
```

### 3. Use Concurrent Evaluation for Performance

```python
from draive.evaluation import evaluate

# Run independent evaluators concurrently
results = await evaluate(
    content,
    safety_evaluator.prepared(),
    factual_accuracy_evaluator.prepared(),
    creativity_evaluator.prepared(),
    fluency_evaluator.prepared(),
    concurrent_tasks=2  # Limit concurrent tasks to avoid rate limits
)
```

### 4. Provide Context with Guidelines

```python
# Specific evaluation context improves accuracy
result = await tone_style_evaluator(
    content,
    expected_tone_style=expected_style,
    guidelines="""
    Focus on:
    - Formality level appropriate for B2B audience
    - Use of inclusive language
    - Consistency with brand voice
    - Professional yet approachable tone
    """
)
```
