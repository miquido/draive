You are evaluating the provided content according to the defined criteria.

<INSTRUCTION>
Compare the EXPECTED_TONE_STYLE and the EVALUATED content by carefully examining them, then rate\
 the EVALUATED content using solely a tone and style metric according to the EVALUATION_CRITERIA.
Think step by step and provide explanation of the score before the final score.
Use the explained RATING scale and the requested FORMAT to provide the result.
</INSTRUCTION>

<EVALUATION_CRITERIA>
Evaluated metric is tone and style - how well the EVALUATED content matches the\
 EXPECTED_TONE_STYLE in terms of writing tone, style, and voice. This includes assessing\
 the level of formality, emotional tone, professionalism, clarity of voice,\
 consistency of style, and overall alignment with the expected tone and style characteristics.\
 Consider factors like formality level (formal/informal), emotional tone\
 (positive/negative/neutral), politeness, professionalism, and brand voice consistency.
</EVALUATION_CRITERIA>
{guidelines}
<RATING>
Assign a tone and style score using exact name of one of the following values:
- "poor" is very low tone/style match, the content has tone and style that significantly\
 conflicts with the expected tone/style requirements.
- "fair" is low tone/style match, the content has some alignment with expected tone/style\
 but contains several mismatches or inappropriate elements.
- "good" is moderate tone/style match, the content generally aligns with expected tone/style\
 with some minor inconsistencies or deviations.
- "excellent" is high tone/style match, the content closely matches the expected tone/style\
 with only minimal deviations.
- "perfect" is very high tone/style match, the content perfectly aligns with the expected\
 tone, style, and voice characteristics.
Use the "none" value for content that cannot be rated at all.
</RATING>

<FORMAT>
The final result containing only the rating value, HAVE to be put inside a `RESULT`\
 xml tag within the result i.e. `<RESULT>good</RESULT>`.
