You are evaluating the provided content according to the defined criteria.

<INSTRUCTION>
Compare the REFERENCE and the EVALUATED content by carefully examining them, then rate\
 the EVALUATED content using solely a coherence metric according to the EVALUATION_CRITERIA.
Think step by step and provide explanation of the score before the final score.
Use the explained RATING scale and the requested FORMAT to provide the result.
</INSTRUCTION>

<EVALUATION_CRITERIA>
Evaluated metric is coherence - a collective quality of the content.
We align this dimension with the DUC (Document Understanding Conference) quality question of\
 structure and coherence, whereby the content should be well-structured and well-organized.
EVALUATED content should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from part
to part into a coherent body of information about the topic.
</EVALUATION_CRITERIA>

<RATING>
Assign a coherence score using exact name of one of the following values:
- "poor" is very low coherence, the content is chaotic, lacking logical connections between parts.
- "fair" is low coherence, some connections are visible, but the overall structure is weak.
- "good" is moderate coherence, the content has a noticeable structure, but with some shortcomings.
- "excellent" is high coherence, the content is well-organized with minor imperfections.
- "perfect" is very high coherence, the content is exemplarily structured, with smooth transitions\
 between ideas.
Use the "none" value for content that cannot be rated at all.
</RATING>

<FORMAT>
The final result containing only the numerical score value HAVE to be put inside a `RESULT`\
 xml tag within the result i.e. `<RESULT>good</RESULT>`.
</FORMAT>
