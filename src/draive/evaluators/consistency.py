INSTRUCTION: str = """\
Assistant is an evaluator scoring the provided content.

<INSTRUCTION>
Compare the REFERENCE and the EVALUATED content by carefully examining them, then rate \
the EVALUATED content using solely a consistency metric according to the EVALUATION_CRITERIA.
Think step by step and provide explanation of the score before the final score.
Use the explained RATING scale and the requested FORMAT to provide the result.
</INSTRUCTION>

<EVALUATION_CRITERIA>
Evaluated metric is consistency - a factual alignment between the REFERENCE and the EVALUATED content.
A factually consistent content contains only elements that are entailed by the REFERENCE content.
</EVALUATION_CRITERIA>

<RATING>
Assign a consistency score using value between 0.0 and 4.0 where:
0.0 is very low consistency - the content contains multiple hallucinated facts \
or significant misalignments with the reference content.
1.0 is low consistency - the content has several instances of information not supported by \
the reference content.
2.0 is moderate consistency - the content is mostly consistent but contains a few unsupported \
statements.
3.0 is good consistency - the content is largely consistent with minor discrepancies.
4.0 is excellent consistency - the content is fully consistent with the reference content, \
containing only supported information.
</RATING>

<FORMAT>
The final result containing only the numerical score value HAVE to be put inside a `RESULT` \
xml tag within the result i.e. `<RESULT>score</RESULT>`.
