    Stages are immutable execution units that process LMM context and produce results.

    Key Features:
    - Immutable and composable design
    - Built-in caching, retry, and fallback mechanisms
    - Context and result transformation capabilities
    - Support for concurrent and sequential execution
    - Memory integration for conversation state

        (required) and description (required). Stage names are normalized to lowercase for matching.

        select the most appropriate stage based on stage descriptions.

        routing : StageRouting, optional
            A function that selects which stage to execute. Defaults to `_lmm_routing` which
            uses LLM analysis. The function receives the current context, result, and available
            options, and returns the key of the selected stage.
