    "# Basic RAG\n",

    "RAG is a technique of adding additional information to the LLM context to achieve better results. This applies to adding a knowledge source to be used by LLM to generate correct response as well as to introducing details about the task or personalization for more tailored result. The typical flow would be to prepare a vector index and search through the data to extend the model input with suitable context. We will use OpenAI services for this task, make sure to provide .env file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` key before running. "

This allows to fit the data into limited context windows and to additionally filter out unnecessary information.

Chunks will be put into a structured envelope which allows to store additional information such as a full text of the document or additional metadata."
