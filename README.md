# üèéÔ∏è draive üèÅ

üèéÔ∏è Fast-track your LLM-based apps with an accessible, production-ready library. üèéÔ∏è

Are you looking for maximum flexibility and efficiency in your next Python library? Tired of unnecessary complexities and inefficient token usage?

üëâ Introducing **draive** - an open-source Python library under the Miquido AI Kickstarter framework, designed to simplify and accelerate the development of LLM-based applications. Get started with draive to streamline your workflow and build powerful, efficient apps with ease.

## üöÄ Quick start

Dive straight into the code and learn how to use draive with our interactive [guides](https://github.com/miquido/draive/tree/main/guides). Check out [Draive AI Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C257Y7-y3ok&list=PLbS8Yksu3iAoRpDOGwP_UmK5s6B3SDz8T) to understand our unique architecture and see real-world applications of Draive in action. For quick solutions to common problems, explore our [cookbooks](https://github.com/miquido/draive/tree/main/cookbooks). 

Great, but how it looks like?

```python
from draive import ctx, generate_text, tool
from draive.openai import OpenAIClient, openai_lmm_invocation


@tool # simply annotate a function as a tool
async def current_time(location: str) -> str:
    return f"Time in {location} is 9:53:22"

async with  ctx.scope( # create execution context
    "example", # give it a name
    openai_lmm_invocation(), # define llm provider for this scope
):
    result: str = await generate_text( # choose the right abstraction, i.e. `generate_text`
        instruction="You are a helpful assistant", # provide clear instructions
        input="What is the time in Krak√≥w?", # give it some input (including multimodal)
        tools=[current_time], # and select any tools you like
    )

    print(result) # to finally get the result!
    # output: The current time in Krak√≥w is 9:53:22.
```

Fully functional examples of using the Draive library are also available in [Draive Examples](https://github.com/miquido/draive-examples) repository.

## ‚ùì What is draive?

- **üß© Flexible integration**: Supports any LLM, external service, and other AI solutions.
- **üßí User-friendly framework**: Designed to build scalable and composable data processing pipelines with ease.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Function-oriented design**: Utilizes basic programming concepts, allowing you to represent complex programs as simple functions.
- **üèóÔ∏è Composable and reusable**: Combine functions to create complex programs, while retaining the ability to use them individually.
- **üìä Diagnostics and metrics**: Offers extensive tools for measuring and debugging complex functionalities.
- **üîÑ Fully typed and asynchronous**: Ensures type safety and efficient asynchronous operations for modern Python apps.

## üß± What can you build with draive?

### ü¶æ RAG applications

RAG enhances model capabilities and personalizes the outputs.

- **Examples**: Question answering, custom knowledge bases.

### üßπ Extracting structured output

Simplified data extraction and structuring.

- **Examples**: Data parsing, report generation.

### ü§ñ Chatbots

Sophisticated conversational agents.

- **Examples**: Customer service bots, virtual assistants.

‚Ä¶ and much more!

## üñ•Ô∏è Install

With pip:

```bash
pip install draive
```

### Optional dependencies

Draive library comes with optional integrations to 3rd party services:

- OpenAI:

Use OpenAI services client, including GPT, dall-e and embedding. Allows to use Azure services as well.

```bash
pip install draive[openai]
```

- Anthropic:

Use Anthropic services client, including Claude.

```bash
pip install draive[anthropic]
```

- Gemini:

Use Google AIStudio services client, including Gemini.

```bash
pip install draive[gemini]
```

- Mistral:

Use Mistral services client. Allows to use Azure services as well.

```bash
pip install draive[mistral]
```

- Ollama:

Use Ollama services client.

```bash
pip install draive[ollama]
```

- Fastembed:

User Fastembed services client.

```bash
pip install draive[fastembed]
```

- SentencePiece:

User SentencePiece model runner. It is used by Gemini and Mistral.

```bash
pip install draive[sentencepiece]
```

## Migration to haiway

Beginning with version 0.29.0, Draive will initiate the migration to [haiway](https://github.com/miquido/haiway) for state and dependency management. Interfaces will be gradually updated to the new system, with a complete transition planned. Interfaces subject to change will be marked as deprecated and maintained for as long as feasible, though no later than the end of the migration period. Once the transition is complete, all deprecated interfaces will be fully removed.
