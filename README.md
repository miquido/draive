üèéÔ∏è A fast, flexible Python library for building powerful LLM workflows and AI apps. üèéÔ∏è

Draive gives you everything you need to turn large language models into production-ready software: structured workflows, tool use, instruction refinement, guardrails, observability, and seamless multi-model integration ‚Äî all in one clean, composable package.

If you've ever felt like you‚Äôre stitching together glue code and hoping for the best ‚Äî Draive is what you wish you'd started with!

## üöÄ Quick start

Dive straight into the code and learn how to use draive with our interactive [guides](https://github.com/miquido/draive/tree/main/guides).
For quick solutions to common problems, explore our [cookbooks](https://github.com/miquido/draive/tree/main/cookbooks).

Here‚Äôs what a simple Draive setup looks like:

```python
from draive import ctx, TextGeneration, tool
from draive.openai import OpenAI, OpenAIChatConfig


@tool # simply annotate a function as a tool
async def current_time(location: str) -> str:
    return f"Time in {location} is 9:53:22"

async with  ctx.scope( # create execution context
    "example", # give it a name
    OpenAIChatConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini"), # prepare configuration
    disposables=[OpenAI()], # define resources and service clients available
):
    result: str = await TextGeneration.generate( # choose a right generation abstraction
        instruction="You are a helpful assistant", # provide clear instructions
        input="What is the time in Krak√≥w?", # give it some input (including multimodal)
        tools=[current_time], # and select any tools you like
    )

    print(result) # to finally get the result!
    # output: The current time in Krak√≥w is 9:53:22.
```

## ‚ùì What is Draive good for?

Draive is built for developers who want clarity, flexibility, and control when working with LLMs.

Whether you‚Äôre building an autonomous agent, automating customer support, generating structured data, or routing across multiple models ‚Äî Draive has your back.

### What you can do with Draive:

- **üîÅ Write smarter instructions** ‚Äî and refine them programmatically
- **üõ† Turn any Python function into a tool** that LLMs can call
- **üîÑ Switch between providers** like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or Mistral in seconds
- **üß± Design structured workflows** using stages, retries, and routing logic
- **üõ° Enforce output structure using guardrails** (e.g., typed JSON)
- **üìä Monitor everything with telemetry** and evaluation tools
- **‚öôÔ∏è Make your flows configuration-driven** and easy to test or deploy

### Why you'll like it:

- **Instruction Optimization**: Draive gives you clean ways to write and refine prompts, including metaprompts, instruction helpers, and optimizers. You can go from raw prompt text to a reusable, structured config in no time.
- **Composable Workflows**: Use Stage, Router, and Tool components to build modular flows. Each piece is reusable, debuggable, and works with the rest of your Python stack.
- **Tooling = Just Python**: Define a tool by writing a function. Annotate it. That‚Äôs it. Draive handles the rest ‚Äî serialization, context, and integration with LLMs.
- **Telemetry + Evaluators**: Draive logs everything you care about: timing, output shape, tool usage, error cases. Evaluators let you benchmark or regression-test LLM behavior like a normal part of your CI.
- **Model-Agnostic by Design**: Built-in support for most major providers.

## üß± What can you build with draive?

These are the kinds of projects Draive was built for:

- **AI agent for content marketing**: Automates blog post drafts, inserts SEO keywords, fetches trends via tools, and publishes to a CMS.
- **Developer assistant bot**: Parses pull requests, summarizes diffs, generates release notes, and responds to GitHub issues.
- **AI-powered customer support**: Reads company docs, routes queries, and calls real tools (like product status or order lookup) to respond accurately.
- **Document parser for finance teams**: Converts PDFs to structured JSON using multimodal input, validates format, and sends summaries via Slack.
- **Realtime dashboard builder**: Accepts natural language queries and builds charts from your own data sources using custom tools.
- and much, much more!
